### What is SLiM?
[SLiM](https://sourceforge.net/projects/slim.berlios/) is an acronym for "Simple Login Manager". Lightweight and easily configurable, SLiM requires minimal dependencies, and none from the *GNOME* or *KDE* desktop environments. It therefore contributes towards a lightweight system for users that also like to use lightweight desktops such as *Xfce*, *Openbox*, and *Fluxbox*. 

**Warning** : The SliM project has been abandoned (last release was 2013, the project homepage is down), and is not fully compatible with *systemd*, including *logind sessions*. Consider using a different *Display manager* or *Xinitrc*.

### Installation

**On Ubuntu** : To install SLiM in ubuntu and ubuntu based os,

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install slim
```

**On Arch** : To install SLiM in arch linux,

```sh
$ sudo pacman -S slim
```

### How to use

clone this repository & then copy all themes in `/usr/share/slim/themes`.
To apply new theme, enter the theme name on the current_theme line in ***/etc/slim.conf*** -

```sh
#current_theme       default
current_theme       milk
```
